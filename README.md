Hello, we are the compiler defilers. Our Group Consist of:
* [Justice Adams (adamsjal@uni.edu)](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI)
* [Harsha Varma (varmak@uni.edu)](https://github.com/harshavarmak)
* [Joshua Hilliard (hilliarj@uni.edu)](https://github.com/hilliardj)


This is the code repository for the Klein Compiler we are writing. We are implementing a
Klein compiler that will translate .kln files into machine language. This compiler
implementation is written in C++. Currently we have a working Scanner which converts
characters in a .kln file into tokens. We developed this using a feature-branch workflow.
You'll notice the repo has an extra outer directory for various reasons including
continous integration purposes.

**A quick note about Visual Studio**. If you don't intend to edit this using visual studio, ignore
the Compiler.sln , Compiler.vcxproj	,Compiler.vcxproj.filters files. If you are, they will
make your life easier!



## PROJECT STRUCTURE:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![Project Structure](https://i.imgur.com/gBPuSSq.png)
	
**SRC:** A directory containing all code for the project. Header files can be found in /header
and implementation files of those headers found in /implementation. You'll notice 
Compiler.cpp and BuildTokens.cpp in the src/ directory. They serve seperate purposes and 
are thus seperated. Compiler.cpp will be our final cpp class containing all other objects
and BuildTokens.cpp prints the tokens of a valid klein file to the screen.
	
**TEST:** A directory containing all files for testing our code. This includes unit test and 
arbitrary (invalid) .kln files for further testing.
	
**PROGRAMS:** A collection of valid .kln programs we have written while building this compiler.
	
**DOCS:** A collection of documents we've used while building this compiler. Includes language
grammer as well as any design docs.
	
**MISC:** Anything else that doesn't fit in an above directory that we feel is 
valuable for you to see!
	
  
	
## TESTING:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We decided to use CATCH, an open source C++ testing framework that's lightweight.
IDE-independent, and fully featured. Their repo descripes it as 
'A modern, C++-native, header-only, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD'. Note that
the catch.h is not ours, we're just using it to test! It's a header-only framework.

To run our test you can compile  
test/*.cpp and src/implementation/*.cpp into an 
excecutable and run it. All you need is a c++ compiler! For Example: Using a visual studio
dev console you could run 

`cl /FeRunTest /EHsc test/*.cpp src/implementation/*.cpp`

Then run the RunTest excecutable with `RunTest.exe` .There you have it.

ALTERNATIVELY: you can run the bash script if you have a g++ compiler and bash :)
**We have verified that this works on STUDENT.CS.UNI.EDU server**. Run it with

`chmod +x runtest.sh`

and

`./runtest.sh`



## BUILD SCRIPTS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will have a build script that takes in several command line arguments. The 
file name is build_klein.sh.  When first using, be sure to update the file 
permissions to allow the file to be executible by entering the following 
command:

chmod +x build_klein.sh

The options for build_klein.sh are

-s or --kleins:  This will build an executible file named kleins that will 
print out all tokens in a .kln file.  'kleins' takes one command line argument
which is the location relative to the current file and returns tokens for each
valid token found.

-p or --kleinp:  This will build an executible file named kleinp that will
determine if a file parses to the grammar of Klein.  'kleinp' will let the user
know if the file parses as a valid Klein file, or will return an error. kleinp'
takes in 1 command line argument, a .kln file location relative to the current
file.

-f or --kleinp: Functionality coming soon!

-v or --kleinv: Functionality coming soon!

-c or --kleinc: Functionality coming soon!

**We have verified that this works on STUDENT.CS.UNI.EDU server.**
